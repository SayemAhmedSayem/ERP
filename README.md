# WHAT IS ERP?
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a business management software system that is designed to manage and streamline an organization’s functions, processes and workflows with automation and integration.

# How does ERP work?
A term coined by Gartner in the 1990s (link resides outside ibm.com), an ERP software system is designed to manage all parts of a business—finance, HR, manufacturing, supply chain, services, procurement, supply chain management, product lifecycle management, project management and more—which makes it an essential part of an organization’s daily operations. ERP software consists of business applications that are all connected and share one common database, therefore decreasing the number of resources necessary to run the business end to end.

The business applications, known as enterprise modules, each focus on a specific business area but work together to meet the company’s needs. Since businesses range in size and needs and no two are alike, modules are not a one-size-fits-all approach. A company can pick and choose which modules are best suited for their business.

The best way an enterprise resource planning system can deliver the most value is when a company takes advantage of modules for each business function. By having a central location for all business data, ERP implementation cuts out the silos that complicate data collection and create data duplication challenges for many businesses. The new system (the ERP model) serves as a single-source-of-truth software solution.

# ERP software systems come in three different forms:
- A cloud subscription model (software as a service)

- A licensing model (on premises)

- A hybrid model


# ERP software system types
There are three types of ERP software systems: onsite systems, cloud-based systems and hybrid systems. They all differ from one another and have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on business needs and ERP approach. Any of these enterprise resource planning software systems can help a company in decision-making and profitability.

### Onsite ERP:
This software, also referred to as on-premises ERP, is deployed onsite and is mostly controlled in-house, or by the company’s enterprise. A business would choose this option if the business wanted to be in total control of the ERP software and security. If you are to choose this ERP software option, it would require a dedicated IT resource on-premises to handle the technical and application maintenance.

### Cloud-based ERP: 
The cloud-based ERP system, often referred to as software-as-a-service or SaaS, means that a third party is managing the ERP software in the cloud. Using technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, this flexible option system can provide greater automation efficiencies and allow employees to search through organizational data on any device through the internet. IBM®, Infor, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP offer new ERP solutions.

This is a popular model for ERP software due to its scalability, agility and lower cost. The main disadvantage is the security risk that you take when trusting an ERP vendor. The data for your business is sensitive and requires careful handling.

### Hybrid ERP: 
This system is for companies looking for characteristics of both an onsite and SaaS model to meet their business requirements. In this model, some of the ERP applications and data will be on the cloud and some are on premises. This can sometimes be referred to as a two-tier ERP.
