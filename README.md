# WHAT IS ERP?
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a business management software system that is designed to manage and streamline an organization’s functions, processes and workflows with automation and integration.

# How does ERP work?
A term coined by Gartner in the 1990s (link resides outside ibm.com), an ERP software system is designed to manage all parts of a business—finance, HR, manufacturing, supply chain, services, procurement, supply chain management, product lifecycle management, project management and more—which makes it an essential part of an organization’s daily operations. ERP software consists of business applications that are all connected and share one common database, therefore decreasing the number of resources necessary to run the business end to end.

The business applications, known as enterprise modules, each focus on a specific business area but work together to meet the company’s needs. Since businesses range in size and needs and no two are alike, modules are not a one-size-fits-all approach. A company can pick and choose which modules are best suited for their business.

The best way an enterprise resource planning system can deliver the most value is when a company takes advantage of modules for each business function. By having a central location for all business data, ERP implementation cuts out the silos that complicate data collection and create data duplication challenges for many businesses. The new system (the ERP model) serves as a single-source-of-truth software solution.

# ERP software systems come in three different forms:
- A cloud subscription model (software as a service)

- A licensing model (on premises)

- A hybrid model
